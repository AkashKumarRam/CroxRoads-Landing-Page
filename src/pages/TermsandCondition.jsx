            encounter any abusive or inappropriate behaviour from other users,
            you agree to report such incidents to us immediately.<br/><br/>

            You agree to <br/><br/>

            &#x2022; Comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to privacy laws, intellectual property laws, anti-spam laws, equal opportunity laws, and regulatory requirements.<br/><br/>

If you encounter any abusive or inappropriate behavior or have any complaints regarding Member Content, you can report it to us by contacting our support team and providing details of the abuse or complaint. You can also report a user directly from their profile or in chat by using the appropriate reporting options. We reserve the right to investigate any potential violations of these Terms, user rights, or third-party rights. In our sole discretion, we may terminate a user's right to use the App without prior notice, as outlined in Section 1 above, and/or remove any improper, infringing, or unauthorized Member Content submitted to the App.<br/><br/>

            Please note that Croxroads does not have control over the actions or statements of its users. Therefore, you are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the App.<br/>

            YOU UNDERSTAND THAT CROXROADS DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS USERS. CROXROADS ALSO DOES NOT INQUIRE INTO THE BACKGROUNDS OF ITS USERS OR ATTEMPT TO VERIFY THE STATEMENTS OF ITS USERS.

This release does not apply to claims, demands, losses, damages, rights, and actions arising from unconscionable commercial practices, fraud, deception, false promises, misrepresentation, concealment, suppression, or omission of any material fact in connection with the App by Croxroads.<br/>

            Unauthorized scraping or replication of any part of the App is expressly prohibited without our prior consent. This includes using any means, automated or otherwise, except through our currently available, published interfaces, unless you have obtained specific permission in a separate agreement with us.<br/><br/>

            Matchmaking and Communication:<br/><br/>
            &#x2022; Matchmaking: The App provides a platform for matching users for double dates. However, we do not guarantee successful matches or connections.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; User Interactions: Users are responsible for their own interactions during meetups. We do not assume liability for any incidents or damages that may occur during or as a result of these interactions.
In-App Purchases and Subscriptions<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; In-App Purchases: Croxroads may offer products and services for purchase within the App ("In-App Purchase"). If you choose to make an In-App Purchase, you acknowledge and agree that additional terms, disclosed to you at the point of purchase, may apply, and that such additional terms are incorporated herein by reference.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; Payment Methods: You may make an In-App Purchase through the following payment methods: (a) making a purchase through a third-party platform, such as the Apple App Store or Google Play Store ("Third Party Store"), or (b) paying with your credit card, debit card, or PayPal account, which will be processed by a third-party processor. By making an In-App Purchase, you authorize us to charge your chosen Payment Method. If payment is not received from your chosen Payment Method, you agree to promptly pay all amounts due upon demand by us.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; Subscriptions and Auto-Renewal: Croxroads may offer certain services as automatically renewing subscriptions, such as one-week, one-month, or three-month subscriptions ("Premium Services"). If you purchase an automatically renewing subscription, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of the period, unless you cancel, at Croxroads' then-current price for such subscriptions. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period. Deleting your account or the application from your device does not cancel your subscription. You will be notified of any changes in the pricing of the Premium Services to which you have subscribed and given an opportunity to cancel. If Croxroads changes the prices and you do not cancel your subscription, you agree to be charged at Croxroads' then-current pricing for the subscription.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; Cancelling Subscriptions: If you purchased a subscription directly from Croxroads, you may cancel or change your Payment Method via the payment settings option under your profile. If you purchased a subscription through a Third Party Store, such as the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store, you will need to access your account with that Third Party Store and follow the instructions to change or cancel your subscription. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of the period you last paid for. However, (i) you will not be eligible for a prorated refund except as set forth in the subsection entitled "Refunds" below, (ii) your subscription will not be renewed when that period expires, and (iii) you will no longer be able to use the Premium Services or In-App Purchases enabled by your subscription.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022; Free Trials: If you sign up for a free trial and do not cancel, your trial may convert into a paid subscription, and your Payment Method will be charged at the then-current price for such subscription. Once your free trial converts to a paid subscription, your paid subscription will continue to automatically renew at the end of each period, and your Payment Method will be charged until you cancel. To avoid charges for a new subscription period, you must cancel before the end of the then-current subscription period or free trial period, as described above. Deleting your account or the application from your device does not cancel your free trial. If you have previously signed up for a free trial on Croxroads through the Apple Store or Google Play Store, you will not be eligible for another free trial, and you will be automatically signed up for a subscription and charged as described in this paragraph.<br/><br/>

            &#x2022;  Refunds: Generally, all charges for purchases are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.<br/><br/>


            Privacy and Data Protection:<br/><br/>
            &#x2022;  Data Collection: We collect and store certain user information in accordance with our Privacy Policy, which is a separate document available on our website.<br/><br/>

            Intellectual Property:<br/><br/>

            &#x2022;  Ownership: All content provided by the App, including logos, designs, trademarks, and any other intellectual property, remains the exclusive property of the App.<br/><br/>

          &#x2022;  Fundamental Element: The limitation of liability set forth herein is a fundamental element of the basis of the bargain between you and Croxroads and reflects a fair allocation of risk.
